# ur5_ag95_moveit_config

## About
This ROS package has been auto-generated by `moveit_setup_assistant`. There a few bugs with the setup assistant. Due to these bugs the changes described in the subsequent section have been done manually.

## Manual changes
1. File: `ros_controllers.yaml`
	
   Changes: 
   1. Addition of '-' before `gripper_finger1_joint`  in the namespace `ag95_gripper_controller` to make sure `joints` is an array.
   2. Addition of the `ur5_arm_controller` and `ag95_gripper_controller` to the `controller_list` as it was an empty array by default.

   <br/>

2. File: `demo_gazebo.launch`
	
   Changes: 
   1. Changed the default value of `load_robot_description` parameter to `true`.
   <br/>
   <br/>

3. File: `move_group.launch`
	
   Changes: 
   1. Removed the `pilz_industrial_motion_planner` that is useless in this case.
   <br/>
   <br/>

4. File: `trajectory_execution.launch.xml`
	
   Changes: 
   1. Removed the `execution_type` argument present as the child element in inclusion of the `ur5_robot_moveit_controller_manager.launch.xml` file. This parameter is not defined in the aforementioned launch file by default.
